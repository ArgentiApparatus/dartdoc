# dartdoc

Use _dartdoc_ to generate HTML documentaton for your Dart package.

Note: As of Dart 1.12-dev.5.10, `dartdoc` is shipped with the Dart SDK and
replaces `docgen` and `dartdoc-viewer`.

If you want to _contribute_ to the dartdoc project, see the
[contributor docs][]. This page contains information about _using_ the dartdoc
tool.

## Installing dartdoc

### From the Dart SDK

[Download the Dart SDK](https://www.dartlang.org/downloads/), version
1.12-dev.5.10 or later. If not already added, add the SDK's `bin` directory to
your `PATH`.

### From pub.dartlang.org

You can install the latest version of dartdoc with `pub`:

    $ pub global activate dartdoc

Note: to ensure that this version is run when you type `dartdoc` on the command
line, make sure that `~/.pub-cache/bin` is on your `PATH`, and before the path
to the Dart SDK.

## Running dartdoc

### Generating docs

Run `dartdoc` from the root directory of package.  For example:

```
$ dartdoc
Generating documentation for 'server_code_lab' into <path-to-server-code-lab>/server_code_lab/doc/api/

parsing lib/client/piratesapi.dart...
parsing lib/common/messages.dart...
parsing lib/common/utils.dart...
parsing lib/server/piratesapi.dart...
Parsed 4 files in 8.1 seconds.

generating docs for library pirate.messages from messages.dart...
generating docs for library pirate.server from piratesapi.dart...
generating docs for library pirate.utils from utils.dart...
generating docs for library server_code_lab.piratesApi.client from piratesapi.dart...
Documented 4 libraries in 9.6 seconds.

Success! Open file:///<path-to-server-code-lab>/server_code_lab/doc/api/index.html
```

By default, the documentation is generated to the `doc/api` directory as static
HTML files.

### Viewing docs

You can view the generated docs directly from the file system, but if you want
to use the search function, you must load them with an HTTP server.

An easy way to run an HTTP server locally is to use the `dhttpd` package. For
example:

```
$ pub global activate dhttpd
$ dhttpd --path doc/api
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser. The search function should
now work.
